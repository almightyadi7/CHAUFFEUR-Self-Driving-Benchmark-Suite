# CHAUFFEUR-Self-Driving-Benchmark-Suite
1. Developed CHAUFFEUR, an open-source self-driving vehicle benchmark suite on Gazebo, optimized for embedded platforms like Drive PX2.
2. Integrated YOLOv3 for 91% accurate object detection, with Structure from Motion for 3D reconstruction and lane detection.
3. Improved vehicle localization using an Extended Kalman Filter, fusing data from IMU, GPS, and LIDAR sensors.
4. Achieved real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance with SLAM and PID controllers.
